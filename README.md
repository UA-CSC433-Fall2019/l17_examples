These examples cover a matrix class built in Javascript, including:
* matrix_text.html -- an HTML page for loading examples
* tester.js -- "main" javascript program which tests out timings for the classes
* vec3.js -- In-class examples 3D vector
* matrix3.js -- 3x3 Matrix class that stores a flat list of 9 numbers
* matrix3_vec3.js -- 3x3 Matrix class that stores a 3 vectors.  Easier to write code for but appears to be slower for multiplication.
